function [xnew] = whitening(x, Fs, varargin) 
%   SPECTRAL WHITENING
%
%   This function generates flat Fourier spectrum for a given signal (which
%   is originally not white) either for the full range of 0 Hz to the
%   Nyquist frequency or for a user defined frequency band. This operation
%   tends to sharpen signal, as well as the noise. The whitening process is
%   often used for ambient vibration data before stacking waveforms for
%   cross-correlation. The whitening process is often used for ambient
%   vibration data before stacking waveforms for cross-correlation. The
%   process is simple as Fourier transforming the signal after applying
%   Hann window, then normalizing its magnitude, and then inverse Fourier
%   transforming it.
%
%   Syntax:    
%       xnew = whitening(x, Fs, freq, []) for the full range of 0 Hz to the
%              Nyquist frequency
%       xnew = whitening(x, Fs, freq, [0.1, 20]) for 0.1 Hz to 20 Hz as 
%              an example
%
%    Input: 
%          x = input signal (x must be a row vector)
%         Fs = sampling rate (e.g., 200)
%       freq = frequency limit for whitening in Hz (e.g., freq, [] or 
%              freq, [0.1, 20])
%
%   Output: 
%       xnew = spectrally whitened signal for the full range of 0 Hz to the
%              Nyquist frequency or within a user defined frequency band
